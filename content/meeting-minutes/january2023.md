The Iola Amateur Radio Club held it's regular meeting on January 14, 2023.

The secretary read the minutes of the last meeting, which were approved.

The president provided a treasurer's report, due to illness.

It was reported that we currently have 8 paid members for 2023.

Meeting times were discussed.  We have a tenative plan to hold meetings on the second Tuesday of the month at 7:00pm.

We also discussed a new location for our meetings, as Tina's Place does not serve us well.  We are currently looking at the old Methodist church on S. Kentucky St. (Now "The Foundry").  This location would potentially give us a location to set up a club shack, as well as other club activities.  We will hold the February meeting at this location.  Since the second Tuesday of February is Valentine's day, we will hold the February meeting on Febuary 7th.

Jeremy will check into the rules regarding the use of the club's callsign.

The following people have agreed to take on leadership of various activities:

- Field Day - Steve
- Presentations - Steve
- ARRL Liason - Steve
- Emergency Communications - Trey
- PR/Outreach - Chase
- Repeaters - Dan
- Liason with other KS nets - Gale
- Classes - Jeremy
- Contesting - Jeremy/Steve
- Website - Jeremy

The LaCygne hamfest is being held on Feburary 4th.

There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.
