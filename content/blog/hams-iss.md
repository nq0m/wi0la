    ARLS001 More Amateur Radio Astronauts Head for the International
    Space Station

    Three of the four new astronauts on February’s planned launch of the
    SpaceX Crew-6 mission to the International Space Station (ISS) are
    amateur radio operators.

    The four crew members that comprise the SpaceX Crew-6 mission are,
    Mission Specialist Andrey Fedyaev, Pilot Warren “Woody” Hoburg,
    Mission Specialist Sultan Al Nedayi, and Commander Stephen Bowen.

    Pilot Warren “Woody” Hoburg, KB3HTZ; Commander Stephen Bowen,
    KI5BKB, and Mission Specialist Sultan Al Neyadi, KI5VTV, will join
    Mission Specialist Andrey Fedyaev on board the SpaceX Dragon
    spacecraft, Endeavour.

    The spacecraft will be atop a Falcon 9 rocket and, while a launch
    date has not been selected, the earliest date would be mid-February
    2023.

    All crew members have learned about Amateur Radio on the
    International Space Station (ARISS), received guidance on studying
    and testing, and learned how to operate the ARISS radios and the
    basics of on-the-air protocol from ARISS team members at NASA’s
    Johnson Space Center.

    The crew will be able to participate in ARISS, using the ham radio
    station on the ISS to contact schools and other educational
    institutions.

    ARISS is a cooperative venture of international amateur radio
    societies and the space agencies that support the ISS. In the US,
    participating organizations include NASA, the ISS National Lab, ARRL
    The National Association for Amateur Radio, and AMSAT.
